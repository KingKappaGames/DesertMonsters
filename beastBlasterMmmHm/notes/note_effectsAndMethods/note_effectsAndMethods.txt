I also need to make it so
the bodies and buildings and whatnot get pushed around and broken apart based on the things in question
rather than just blood spawning where the enemy was. This would be very cool!

So, large clouds of blended white fire that fades to black with gravity and a shockwave of both debris particles
and an actual shockwave of damage that would knock away and kill enemies or buildings or cars, ect.

I think the first kind of building I should make is actually trees, dead trees or palm trees that wave around
like they are in wind or bobbing ect and they can get wiggled by bombs and nukes and ect. They would have multiple
segments that bent together and could break apart into pieces with particles and such to show leaves being knocked
off or pieces being broken away. These pieces could then fall to the ground and maybe become debris?




For the randomly generated villages: Instead of trying to generate one piece at a time like a bozo just find a good spot
and generate the whole village there regardless of terrain changes (or make a function to pick the point from the numbers)
and use that to check areas but still, generate the villages in clusters instead of randomly bozo
Then you can use all kinds of generation tricks like those I described in the space game to do simple note to make the 
things themselves. Lot's of options here.
