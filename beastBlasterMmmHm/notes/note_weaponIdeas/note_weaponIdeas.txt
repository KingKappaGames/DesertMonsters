laser that sinks into ground or not depending on what it hits and produces different cones and delays
of explosion depending with bright white gleams and nuclear style enery explusions. Very much
like the classical energy beams of mecha and godzilla movies and anime. sounds a bit tough!

Airstrikes, of course, lines of bombing, cluster bombing, ect

bigger f4204024 missiles of course

guns, simple person held guns, and also playable people and military conflicts... Oh yeah that too

mines? Kind of weird to have mines drop from planes or maybe have foot soldiers lay the mines idk

fire? Napalm?

melting beams or disintegration beams alien style?
